This is our free introductory meeting.  The agenda is to talk about the goal you want to acheive with your website.

We will give our thoughts about how your site might be organized and how we can meet any particular technical needs.

If we don't think our process will be able to meet your needs, we'll let you know.  We may suggest a simpler alternative to your vision that could be completed in 5 meetings.  Otherwise we'll try to point you towards other organizations that may better help you.
