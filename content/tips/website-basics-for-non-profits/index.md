Non-profits have a unique challenge - building sites that are easy to update, can handle changes in leadership and a range of technical abilities, and won't break the bank. Here's our guide for how non-profits and resource constrained organizations can use fundamental web technologies to create and deploy sites for these requirements.

### Stability

Sites for long lasting public institutions are hard to keep current. Government institutions are one of the last bastions of 90s web design, and non-profits have a fraction of those resources. There are two facets of stability to be aware of: security and ease of maintainance.

#### Security
We've worked with organizations getting hacked on a weekly basis because their site was using cutting edge technology - from 15 years ago. Technology constantly evolves and what is safe today will be harder to secure tomorrow. This is doubly true if your organization has a database. 

There are three security concerns for most non-profits
1. Keeping organizational data safe
1. Preventing the site from giving users evil code
1. Preventing the resources used for the site from hosting other more evil sites

Questions to consider:
Does my organization need a database? What data does the organization need to keep?
Are there administrative tools my organization wants built into the website? Who uses those tools?

### Cost

A large portion of many non-profit budgets is website hosting and maintenance.
