T﻿here are some obvious signs of website failure, but websites can also fail in hard to find ways. Fortunately, anyone can use simple tools to find out if their website has mistakes.

The two categories of tools are user testing and technical testing. User testing asks people to use the website and give feedback. You want to be sure users see and understand the most important parts of a page. Technical testing is making sure nothing is broken in a way that impacts the effectiveness of a website.


#﻿# User Testing
User testing dates back to the earliest tools. For a tool to work in a social setting, it needs to be understood when it’s handed from one person to the next. Companies spend billions of dollars to understand exactly how their tools are used, carefully comparing options and making tiny changes to improve user interactions. 
Asking a friend or stranger to give feedback about your site is the first step toward understanding how someone else interacts with your website. Here’s how to get the most out of asking for a review.
### Be Prepared
Understand the goals of your website. Do you want people to read a post, sign upf or an email list, or see product offerings? If you understand the goals of your website, you can start to evaluate how they’re doing
### Be Open
If you’re watching the user interact with your site, don’t give them feedback. It can be extremely tempting to tell people where and how to click.
